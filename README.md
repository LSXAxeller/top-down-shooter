# Introduction

As a side project, I am currently working on a top down shooter kit (for games like zombie/survival waves, team deathmatch, counter strike), that will look professional compared and compatable on mobile devices, including a lot of advanced features (AI, map editor) that can be implemented easily. Im not showcasing this kit yet, but maybe some betas can be tested if requested. Most kits are hard to use and difficult for beginners (most unity users that use kits are beginners), and thus this user friendly kit should contain custom inspectors, and documentation. But I need some advice on features, and opinions. I also need a catchy name. Thanks guys.As



# Progress

- Multithreading for tile management

- More tile paint brushes including box fill (think magic wand from minecraft => massive time saver)

- You can now hide the tile picker to save space

Finally introduced entities as a counterpart to tiles (are also serialized just as tiles in .map files)
